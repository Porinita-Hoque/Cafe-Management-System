# <p align="center"> Cafeteria Management System </p>


<p align="justify">The Cafeteria Management System is a software application developed to automate and streamline the operations of a cafeteria or food service establishment. This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly solution for managing various activities in a cafeteria, including order placement, inventory management, employee management, and sales tracking. The system is developed using the Java programming language, providing a robust and scalable platform.</p>

## Objectives
The main objectives of the Cafeteria Management System project are as follows:

- **Efficient Order Placement**: The system allows customers to place orders easily, eliminating the need for manual order taking and reducing errors.
- **Inventory Management**: The system maintains a centralized database of food items and ingredients, ensuring efficient stock management and avoiding shortages or excesses.
- **Employee Management**: The system provides features for managing cafeteria staff, including their attendance, shifts, and performance tracking.
- **Sales Tracking**: The system tracks daily sales, generates reports, and provides insights into the popularity of various food items and revenue generation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for both customers and cafeteria staff to navigate and use.

## System Architecture
The Cafeteria Management System is designed using a three-tier architecture:

- **Presentation Layer**: This layer is responsible for the user interface and interaction. It includes components such as forms, menus, and screens that allow users to interact with the system.
- **Application Layer**: The application layer contains the business logic of the system. It handles tasks such as order processing, inventory management, employee management, and generating reports.
- **Data Layer**: The data layer manages the storage and retrieval of data. It includes a database to store information related to food items, ingredients, orders, employees, and sales.

## System Features
The Cafeteria Management System offers the following key features:

- **User Registration and Login**: Customers can create accounts and log in to place orders, while cafeteria staff can access additional features such as inventory management and sales tracking.
- **Menu Management**: The system provides an interface to manage the cafeteria menu, including adding, updating, and removing food items and their prices.
- **Order Placement**: Customers can browse the menu, select items, specify quantities, and place orders. The system calculates the total amount and generates an order confirmation.
- **Inventory Management**: The system keeps track of food item stock levels, automatically updating them upon order placement and providing alerts for low stock items.
- **Employee Management**: Cafeteria staff can manage employee information, track attendance, assign shifts, and monitor performance.
- **Sales Tracking and Reporting**: The system generates reports on daily sales, popular food items, and revenue generated. This data can be used for analysis and decision-making.

## Technologies Used
The Cafeteria Management System is developed using the following technologies:

- **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the system's functionality and logic.
- **JavaFX**: A Java library used for developing the graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- **MySQL**: A relational database management system used for storing and retrieving data.
- **JDBC**: A Java API used for connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.

## Database Structure
The Cafeteria Management System uses the following database tables to store relevant information:

- **consumption** table: Tracks consumption details, including the date, number of students, total consumption, and wastage.
- **item_removed** table: Records the items removed from inventory, including the date, quantity of rice, beef, chicken, and the total number of items removed.
- **item_added** table: Keeps track of the items added to inventory, including the date, quantity of rice, beef, chicken, their respective prices, and the total cost.
- **inventory** table: Stores the current inventory levels for rice, beef, and chicken, identified by a unique ID.
- **menu** table: Defines the menu for each day, including the day of the week and the quantity of rice, beef, and chicken available.


## Conclusion
<p align="justify">The Cafeteria Management System provides an efficient and reliable solution for managing cafeteria operations. By automating various tasks such as order placement, inventory management, and sales tracking, the system simplifies the workflow, enhances productivity, and improves the overall customer experience. With potential future enhancements, the system can further streamline operations and cater to evolving customer needs.</p>
